    <h1>Welcome to How to Adult with help from YouTube!</h1>
    This is a list of things that as adults, we should know how to do, but probably no one ever taught you.<br/>
    You can browse the list, search by category, or add new videos of things YOU think adults need to know!<br/>

    <!--If bookmarks is missing from the model, the rest just silently won't load.-->
    <!--Since that's confusing, instead of silently skipping the render, explain that something is wrong -->
    <p th:unless="${titles}">Something went wrong. Unable to load bookmarks</p>

    <br/><br/>
    <!--todo switch these to bookmarks.size()-->
    Number of videos currently in the system: <span th:text="${titles.size()}"/>.

    <ul>
        <li th:each="titles: ${titles}" th:text="${titles.title}">title goes here!</li>
        <!--<li th:each="titles: ${titles}" th:text="${bookmark.title}"></li>-->
    </ul>
