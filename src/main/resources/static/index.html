<h1>Adulting 101</h1>

<h2><em>Deep Breath</em></h2>

<p> Do you emotionally identify with memes that reference having a favorite stove top burner, or
getting angry when the grocery store is rearranged?

    If you answered yes, then you are most definitely an adult!

What!?  You don't FEEL like an adult?  Neither do the rest of us, honey.

When you are too embarrassed to admit to your parents or your friends that you can't complete the simple task of
tying a tie, cooking a simple meal, or filling out your tax forms for your new job, LOOK NO FURTHER!

This site is a a compilation of instructional videos that will help you complete the mundane tasks that are now your
adult responsibilities.
